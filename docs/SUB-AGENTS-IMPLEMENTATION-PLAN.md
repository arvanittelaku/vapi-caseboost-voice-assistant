## 🔄 ROUTING & HANDOFF LOGIC

### Primary Agent (Sarah) - The Router

**Responsibilities:**

1. Greet the caller warmly
2. Ask open-ended discovery questions
3. Identify primary service interest through keywords
4. Brief introduction to the relevant specialist
5. Seamless handoff to sub-agent

**Example Flow:**

```
Sarah: "Hello, this is Sarah from CaseBoost. I understand you're interested
in growing your legal practice. Could you tell me a bit about what you're
looking for?"

Prospect: "We want to get more personal injury cases immediately."

Sarah: "Fantastic! It sounds like our Performance Lead Delivery service
might be perfect for you. Let me connect you with Paula, our lead delivery
specialist who can explain exactly how we deliver qualified personal injury
cases daily. One moment..."

[HANDOFF TO PAULA - PERFORMANCE LEAD DELIVERY SUB-AGENT]

Paula: "Hi there! Sarah mentioned you're looking for immediate personal
injury cases. I'd love to tell you about our performance-based lead
delivery. We deliver pre-qualified, ready-to-close PI cases directly to
your firm. How many new cases are you looking to take on per month?"
```

### Keyword Detection for Routing

**Service Keywords:**

- **Mass Tort:** "mass tort", "class action", "group cases", "large volume", "pharmaceutical"
- **Performance Leads:** "immediate leads", "buy leads", "quick results", "ready to close", "no setup"
- **AI Intake:** "AI", "automation", "24/7", "intake", "response time", "chatbot"
- **PPC:** "Google Ads", "paid advertising", "PPC", "Facebook ads", "YouTube"
- **SEO:** "SEO", "organic", "rankings", "content", "long-term growth"
- **Website:** "website", "web design", "landing page", "conversion"
- **CRM:** "CRM", "automation", "follow-up", "pipeline", "lead management"
- **Practice Area:** "medical malpractice", "immigration", "personal injury", "divorce"

### Handoff Protocol

**Technical Implementation:**

1. Primary agent identifies service intent
2. Calls webhook function: `route_to_sub_agent(service_type, context)`
3. System updates conversation metadata
4. System injects sub-agent personality/knowledge
5. Sub-agent takes over with context
6. Conversation continues seamlessly

**User Experience:**

- Smooth transition ("Let me connect you with our specialist...")
- Context preservation (no repeating information)
- Consistent brand voice across agents
- Easy return to general questions if needed

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES

### **Approach A: Native VAPI with Dynamic System Messages** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**How It Works:**

- Use VAPI's custom function calling to detect service interest
- Webhook receives service type and returns appropriate system message
- System message dynamically loads sub-agent personality and knowledge
- Same VAPI assistant, different "personas"

**Pros:**
✅ Minimal infrastructure changes
✅ Works entirely within VAPI
✅ Lower latency
✅ Easier to maintain
✅ No additional frameworks needed
✅ Seamless for the user

**Cons:**
❌ Limited to VAPI's function calling capabilities
❌ Less sophisticated agent collaboration
❌ Single knowledge base (need smart organization)

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create sub-agent personality configs
2. Implement routing webhook endpoint
3. Add function call definition for routing
4. Update knowledge base with sub-agent sections
5. Test routing logic
6. Deploy and monitor

**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

---

### **Approach B: CrewAI Orchestration Layer**

**How It Works:**

- Build CrewAI layer between caller and VAPI
- CrewAI manages multiple specialized agents
- Each agent has own knowledge base and tools
- CrewAI handles routing, context, and collaboration
- VAPI used for voice interface only

**Pros:**
✅ True multi-agent capabilities
✅ Independent knowledge bases
✅ Better agent collaboration
✅ More sophisticated routing
✅ Future-proof for complex workflows

**Cons:**
❌ Significant architecture changes
❌ Additional infrastructure layer
❌ Higher latency (extra processing)
❌ More complex debugging
❌ Steeper learning curve

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Set up CrewAI environment
2. Create agent definitions for each service
3. Build routing and coordination logic
4. Integrate with VAPI for voice I/O
5. Create individual knowledge bases
6. Implement handoff protocols
7. Extensive testing
8. Deploy and optimize

**Estimated Timeline:** 6-8 weeks

---

### **Approach C: Hybrid - VAPI + Lightweight Orchestrator**

**How It Works:**

- Custom lightweight orchestrator (Node.js)
- Manages agent state and routing
- Uses VAPI for voice interface
- Simplified version of CrewAI approach
- Built specifically for voice use case

**Pros:**
✅ More control than pure VAPI
✅ Simpler than full CrewAI
✅ Optimized for voice
✅ Moderate development effort
✅ Good balance of power and simplicity

**Cons:**
❌ Custom code to maintain
❌ Not as feature-rich as CrewAI
❌ Still adds infrastructure complexity

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Design orchestrator architecture
2. Build routing engine
3. Create agent state management
4. Integrate with VAPI
5. Implement knowledge routing
6. Test and optimize
7. Deploy

**Estimated Timeline:** 4-5 weeks

  expertise: [
    "Mass tort marketing campaigns",
    "Class action client acquisition",
    "Multi-plaintiff case management",
    "Compliance for group advertising",
  ],
  greeting:
    "Hi! I'm Marcus, CaseBoost's mass tort marketing specialist. Sarah mentioned you're interested in scaling up with mass tort cases. I'd love to tell you about our large-scale client acquisition strategies. What type of mass tort work are you focusing on?",
  systemMessage: `You are Marcus, a mass tort marketing specialist at CaseBoost...`,
  knowledgeFiles: [
    "mass-tort-marketing.txt",
    "compliance.txt",
    "case-studies-mass-tort.txt",
  ],
  qualificationQuestions: [
    "What type of mass tort cases are you interested in?",

    avgROI: "5-10x",
  },
};
```

---

### Step 2: Implement Routing Webhook

**Endpoint:** `/webhook/route-sub-agent`

**Logic:**

```javascript
const routingConfig = require("../config/routing-config");

async function routeToSubAgent(req, res) {
  const { conversation, userMessage, currentContext } = req.body;

  // Analyze user message for service intent
  const serviceIntent = detectServiceIntent(userMessage);

  // Load appropriate sub-agent config
  const subAgent = loadSubAgentConfig(serviceIntent);

  // Return sub-agent system message and greeting
  res.json({
    subAgent: subAgent.name,
    systemMessage: subAgent.systemMessage,
    greeting: subAgent.greeting,
    knowledgeFiles: subAgent.knowledgeFiles,
  });
}

function detectServiceIntent(message) {
  const keywords = routingConfig.keywords;

  // Check for each service type
  for (const [service, terms] of Object.entries(keywords)) {
    if (terms.some((term) => message.toLowerCase().includes(term))) {
      return service;
    }
  }

  return "general"; // Default to primary agent
}
```

---

### Step 3: Update VAPI Function Definition

Add to `assistant-config.js`:

```javascript
{
  type: "function",
  function: {
    name: "route_to_specialist",
    description: "Route conversation to a specialized sub-agent based on service interest",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        service_type: {
          type: "string",
          enum: [
            "mass_tort_marketing",
            "performance_lead_delivery",
            "ai_intake",
            "ppc",
            "seo",
            "web_design",
            "crm",
            "practice_area"
          ],
          description: "The type of service the prospect is interested in"
        },
        detected_keywords: {
          type: "array",
          items: { type: "string" },
          description: "Keywords that triggered this routing decision"
        },
        conversation_context: {
          type: "string",
          description: "Brief summary of conversation so far"
        }
      },
      required: ["service_type"]
    }
  }
}
```

├── business-model.txt
├── compliance.txt
└── ...
```

**New Structure:**

```
