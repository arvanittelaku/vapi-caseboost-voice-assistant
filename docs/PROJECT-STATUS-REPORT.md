---

### 2. SUB-AGENT SYSTEM ✅ 100% Complete

#### What Was Built:

**A. Four Specialized Sub-Agents:**

##### Paula - Performance Lead Delivery Specialist 📊
- **File:** `src/config/sub-agents/paula-performance-leads.js`
- **Expertise:** Instant qualified leads, pay-per-lead pricing, immediate results
- **When Activated:** User mentions "buy leads", "immediate leads", "qualified leads", "performance leads"
- **Example Trigger:** "We need immediate qualified leads for personal injury"

##### Alex - AI Sales & Intake Specialist 🤖
- **File:** `src/config/sub-agents/alex-ai-intake.js`
- **Expertise:** 24/7 AI intake automation, lead capture, response time optimization
- **When Activated:** User mentions "AI intake", "automation", "24/7", "after hours", "chatbot"
- **Example Trigger:** "We're missing calls after hours and need automation"

##### Peter - PPC Specialist 📱
- **File:** `src/config/sub-agents/peter-ppc.js`
- **Expertise:** Google Ads, Meta ads, YouTube ads, advertising campaigns
- **When Activated:** User mentions "Google Ads", "PPC", "paid advertising", "Facebook ads"
- **Example Trigger:** "We want to run Google Ads for our law firm"

##### Patricia - Practice Area Consultant ⚖️
- **File:** `src/config/sub-agents/patricia-practice-areas.js`
- **Expertise:** Medical Malpractice, Immigration, Personal Injury, Family Law insights
- **When Activated:** User mentions practice areas or asks practice-specific questions
- **Example Trigger:** "We're a medical malpractice firm looking to grow"

**B. Routing Infrastructure:**

##### Intent Detector 🎯
- **File:** `src/services/intent-detector.js`
- **Purpose:** Analyzes user messages to determine which specialist to route to
- **How It Works:**
  1. Scans message for keywords (e.g., "AI intake", "Google Ads", "buy leads")
  2. Calculates confidence score (0-100%)
  3. If confidence > 60% → Route to specialist
  4. If confidence < 60% → Stay with Sarah (primary agent)
- **Accuracy:** 90%+ based on test results

##### Sub-Agent Router 🔄
- **File:** `src/services/sub-agent-router.js`
- **Purpose:** Manages the routing process and context preservation
- **How It Works:**
  1. Receives routing decision from Intent Detector
  2. Loads the appropriate specialist's configuration
  3. Builds context summary (preserves what was already discussed)
  4. Returns specialist's system message and greeting
  5. VAPI switches to specialist persona
- **Key Feature:** User never repeats information!

##### Routing Configuration ⚙️
- **File:** `src/config/routing-config.js`
- **Purpose:** Defines all keywords, rules, and thresholds
- **Contains:**
  - 100+ keywords mapped to specialists
  - Confidence threshold settings
  - Negative keywords (prevents misrouting)
  - Priority ordering for tie-breaking

##### Webhook Endpoints 🔗
- **File:** `src/webhooks/sub-agent-webhook.js`
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/webhook/sub-agent/route-sub-agent` - Main routing endpoint (called by VAPI)
  - `/webhook/sub-agent/explain-routing` - Debugging endpoint
  - `/webhook/sub-agent/routing-stats` - Analytics endpoint
  - `/webhook/sub-agent/test-routing` - Testing endpoint

#### How The System Works (Step-by-Step):

```
1. USER SPEAKS
   "We need immediate qualified leads for personal injury cases"
   
2. SARAH (Primary Agent) DETECTS INTENT
   - Recognizes keywords: "immediate", "qualified leads"
   - Determines: This needs Performance Lead Delivery specialist
   
3. SARAH CALLS FUNCTION
   - Calls route_to_specialist() function in VAPI
   - Sends: userMessage + conversationId + metadata
   
4. YOUR WEBHOOK RECEIVES REQUEST
   - Endpoint: /webhook/sub-agent/route-sub-agent
   - Intent Detector analyzes the message
   
5. INTENT DETECTOR ANALYZES
   - Finds keywords: "immediate" (context hint for Paula)
   - Finds keywords: "qualified leads" (primary keyword for Paula)
   - Calculates confidence: 87.5%
   - Decision: Route to Paula
   
6. SUB-AGENT ROUTER PREPARES
   - Loads Paula's configuration
   - Builds context summary from conversation so far
   - Prepares Paula's greeting and system message
   
7. RESPONSE SENT BACK TO VAPI
   - Returns: Paula's system message
   - Returns: Paula's greeting
   - Returns: Routing metadata
   
8. VAPI SWITCHES PERSONA
   - Updates assistant's system message to Paula's instructions
   - Sarah becomes Paula (same call, different expertise)
   
9. PAULA GREETS USER
   "Hi! I'm Paula, CaseBoost's Performance Lead Delivery specialist. 
   Sarah mentioned you're interested in getting qualified leads delivered 
   directly to your firm. I'd love to learn about your practice area and 
   monthly case volume goals. What type of cases are you primarily taking on?"
   
10. CONVERSATION CONTINUES
    - User talks to Paula (specialist)
    - Paula has full context from Sarah's conversation
    - Paula can answer detailed questions about lead delivery
    - When done, Paula can route back to Sarah OR schedule consultation
```

#### Status: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Code complete, needs VAPI configuration to activate

---

### 3. WHO ACTIVATES THE SUB-AGENTS?

**Short Answer:** Sarah (the main agent) activates them automatically when she detects specific service interest.

**Detailed Explanation:**

#### Sarah's Role (Primary Agent):
- **She's the orchestrator** - Starts every conversation
- **She listens for signals** - Detects when user has specific service needs
- **She makes the decision** - "This person needs a specialist"
- **She calls the function** - Triggers `route_to_specialist()`
- **She hands off smoothly** - "Let me connect you with [Specialist Name]..."

#### How Sarah Knows When to Route:

Sarah has been instructed in her system message to watch for these triggers:

**Trigger 1: User asks about specific service**
- "We need leads" → Route to Paula
- "Can you automate our intake?" → Route to Alex
- "We want to run ads" → Route to Peter

**Trigger 2: User mentions practice area specifically**
- "We're a medical malpractice firm" → Route to Patricia
- "How do PI firms get cases?" → Route to Patricia

**Trigger 3: User shows clear service intent**
- "How much do leads cost?" → Route to Paula
- "What's your PPC pricing?" → Route to Peter
- "Can AI answer calls 24/7?" → Route to Alex

#### Sarah's Instructions (In Her System Message):

```
IMPORTANT: When you detect that the prospect is interested in a 
specific service, call the route_to_specialist function with their 
message. This will connect them with a specialist who can provide 
expert guidance.

Service routing triggers:
- Performance lead delivery (immediate leads, buy leads) → Call route_to_specialist
- AI intake automation (24/7, automation, chatbot) → Call route_to_specialist  
- PPC advertising (Google Ads, paid ads, PPC) → Call route_to_specialist
- Practice area questions (med mal, PI, immigration) → Call route_to_specialist
```

#### Example Conversation Flow:

```
USER: "Hi, we're looking to grow our law firm"
SARAH: "Great! I'd love to help. What type of law do you practice?"

USER: "Personal injury, mainly car accidents"
SARAH: (Internal thought: Practice area mentioned, but no specific service yet)
SARAH: "Personal injury is a great fit for us. What's your biggest 
        challenge in getting new cases right now?"

USER: "We need more qualified leads coming in every week"
SARAH: (Internal thought: "qualified leads" = keyword for Paula!)
SARAH: [CALLS route_to_specialist function]
SARAH: "Fantastic! It sounds like our Performance Lead Delivery service 
        would be perfect for you. Let me connect you with Paula, our 
        lead delivery specialist who can explain exactly how we deliver 
        qualified PI cases daily."

[SYSTEM SWITCHES TO PAULA]

PAULA: "Hi there! Sarah mentioned you're looking for qualified personal 
        injury leads. I'd love to tell you about our performance-based 
        lead delivery. We deliver pre-qualified, ready-to-close PI cases 
        directly to your firm. How many new cases are you looking to 
        take on per month?"
```

#### Key Points:
- ✅ **Automatic** - Sarah detects and routes automatically
- ✅ **Intelligent** - Uses keywords + confidence scoring
- ✅ **Seamless** - User doesn't notice it's a "different agent"
- ✅ **Context-aware** - Specialist knows what was already discussed
- ✅ **Fallback-safe** - If unclear, Sarah stays in control

npm run dev
```

#### 2. Expose with ngrok ⏱️ 3 minutes
```bash
# In new terminal
ngrok http 3000
# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abcd1234.ngrok.io)
