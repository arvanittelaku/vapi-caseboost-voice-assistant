| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| Empty message     | `""`                                                      | No routing, null agent     | Routed to null (0% confidence)   | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Gibberish         | `"asdfghjkl qwertyuiop"`                                  | Fallback to Sarah          | Routed to Sarah (0% confidence)  | ‚úÖ PASS |

- ‚úÖ No keyword matches ‚Üí 0% confidence (fallback to Sarah)
- ‚úÖ Threshold (60%) enforced correctly
- ‚úÖ Primary keywords weighted 3x more than secondary
- ‚úÖ Service keywords prioritized over practice area keywords

**Result:** Confidence system working correctly ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ùå WHAT I DID NOT TEST (Requires Live Testing)

### These aspects can ONLY be tested with real VAPI calls:

#### 1. ‚ùå Sarah's Actual Routing Behavior

**What This Means:**  
The local tests verify that our webhook _can_ identify the right specialist. But we haven't tested if **Sarah (the VAPI assistant) will actually call the function** when she detects the keywords.

**Why It Matters:**  
Sarah needs to be configured in VAPI to:

- Recognize when routing is needed
- Call the `route_to_specialist` function
- Pass the correct parameters

**How to Test:**

1. Deploy server + ngrok
2. Configure VAPI with the function
3. Call the assistant
4. Say: "We need immediate qualified leads"
5. Verify Sarah routes to Paula

**Risk if Not Tested:**  
Sarah might not call the function at all, or might call it with incorrect parameters.

---

#### 2. ‚ùå Context Preservation During Switch

**What This Means:**  
When Sarah routes to Paula, does Paula know what was already discussed? For example:

```
USER: "Hi, my name is John Smith from Smith & Associates."
SARAH: "Great to meet you John! What type of law do you practice?"
USER: "Personal injury. We need immediate qualified leads."
SARAH: [Routes to Paula]
PAULA: "Hi John from Smith & Associates! I understand you need qualified
        personal injury leads. How many cases are you looking to take on?"
```

Did Paula remember:

- ‚úÖ User's name (John Smith)
- ‚úÖ Firm name (Smith & Associates)
- ‚úÖ Practice area (Personal Injury)

**Why It Matters:**  
If context isn't preserved, users will have to repeat themselves, creating a poor experience.

**How to Test:**

1. Make a real call
2. Introduce yourself with details
3. Trigger a routing
4. Verify the specialist references previous details

**Risk if Not Tested:**  
User frustration: "I just told you my name!"

---

#### 3. ‚ùå Natural Conversation Flow

**What This Means:**  
Does the transition from Sarah to a specialist feel natural, or does it feel abrupt/robotic?

**Example of Good Flow:**

```
USER: "We need more clients for our medical malpractice practice."
SARAH: "Medical malpractice is a great fit for us! I'd love to connect you
        with Patricia, our practice area consultant who specializes in helping
        med mal firms grow. She can share specific insights about case values
        and acquisition strategies for your field. Let me bring her in."
PATRICIA: "Hi there! Sarah mentioned you're focused on medical malpractice..."
```

**Example of Bad Flow:**

```
USER: "We need more clients for our medical malpractice practice."
SARAH: [Abruptly] "Transferring to Patricia."
PATRICIA: "Hi. I'm Patricia."
```

**Why It Matters:**  
Smooth transitions build trust. Abrupt switches feel like bad customer service.

**How to Test:**

1. Make multiple test calls
2. Trigger different routing scenarios
3. Listen for natural language
4. Verify Sarah "introduces" the specialist
5. Verify specialist acknowledges the handoff

**Risk if Not Tested:**  
Poor user experience, feels robotic or unprofessional.

---

#### 4. ‚ùå VAPI System Message Injection

**What This Means:**  
When our webhook returns a specialist's `systemMessage`, does VAPI actually update the assistant's behavior in real-time?

**What Should Happen:**

1. Sarah is using her general system message
2. Routing function is called
3. Webhook returns Paula's system message
4. VAPI updates the assistant to use Paula's instructions
5. Assistant now behaves like Paula (Performance Lead specialist)

**Why It Matters:**  
If VAPI doesn't inject the new system message, the specialist won't have the right knowledge or personality.

**How to Test:**

1. Make a call and trigger routing to Paula
2. Ask a detailed question: "What's your cost per lead for PI cases?"
3. Verify Paula responds with performance lead knowledge
4. Verify Paula's personality (data-driven, ROI-focused)

**Risk if Not Tested:**  
The "specialist" might just be Sarah pretending, without actual specialist knowledge.

---

#### 5. ‚ùå Specialist Knowledge Accuracy

**What This Means:**  
Do the specialists actually know their domain? Can Paula answer detailed questions about lead delivery? Can Peter discuss PPC metrics?

**Example Questions to Test:**

**Paula:**

- "What's your typical cost per lead for personal injury?"
- "How do you pre-qualify leads?"
- "What's your close rate on delivered leads?"

**Alex:**

- "How does your AI handle complex case intake?"
- "What's your average response time?"
- "Can the AI integrate with our CRM?"

**Peter:**

- "What's a good CTR for legal PPC?"
- "What's your average ROAS?"
- "Should I use Google Ads or Meta ads for PI cases?"

**Patricia:**

- "What's the average case value for medical malpractice?"
- "How many cases do you recommend taking monthly?"
- "What's the best lead source for immigration law?"

**Why It Matters:**  
If specialists can't answer domain-specific questions, they're useless.

**How to Test:**

1. Route to each specialist
2. Ask 3-5 detailed questions in their domain
3. Verify answers are accurate and helpful
4. Verify they don't say "I don't know" for basic questions

**Risk if Not Tested:**  
Specialists might be generic, defeating the purpose of routing.

---

#### 6. ‚ùå Error Handling in Live Calls

**What This Means:**  
What happens if:

- Webhook is down?
- Routing function fails?
- Network timeout?

**Expected Behavior:**

- ‚úÖ Sarah should gracefully continue the conversation
- ‚úÖ User shouldn't notice an error occurred
- ‚úÖ Fallback to Sarah (general agent) if routing fails

**How to Test:**

1. Trigger routing with webhook server OFF
2. Verify call doesn't drop
3. Verify Sarah continues conversation
4. Check logs for error handling

**Risk if Not Tested:**  
Call drops, awkward silence, or error messages exposed to user.

---

#### 7. ‚ùå Routing Back to Sarah (Return Journey)

**What This Means:**  
Can a specialist route back to Sarah if needed? For example:

```
PATRICIA: "Based on what you've told me, I think our Performance Lead
           Delivery service might be a better fit for your immediate needs.
           Let me connect you back with Sarah who can help coordinate."
[Routes back to Sarah]
SARAH: "Thanks Patricia! So, John, it sounds like immediate lead delivery
        is your priority. Let's talk about next steps..."
```

**Why It Matters:**  
Sometimes a specialist realizes the user needs a different service. They should be able to hand off smoothly.

**How to Test:**

1. Route to a specialist
2. Specialist identifies need for different service
3. Verify specialist can route to another specialist or back to Sarah
4. Verify context is preserved

**Risk if Not Tested:**  
User gets stuck with wrong specialist, can't get to the right help.

---

#### 8. ‚ùå Conversation Continuity After Routing

**What This Means:**  
After routing to a specialist, can the conversation continue naturally? Or does it feel like a "restart"?

**Good Experience:**

```
SARAH: "What challenges are you facing?"
USER: "We're not capturing leads after hours."
SARAH: "Perfect! Let me connect you with Alex, our AI intake specialist."
ALEX: "Hi! Sarah mentioned you're missing after-hours leads. How many calls
       do you estimate you're missing per week?"
[Conversation flows naturally]
```

**Bad Experience:**

```
SARAH: "What challenges are you facing?"
USER: "We're not capturing leads after hours."
SARAH: "Let me connect you with Alex."
ALEX: "Hello. How can I help you?"
[User has to repeat everything]
```

**How to Test:**

1. Make multiple calls with routing
2. Verify specialists reference previous conversation
3. Verify no awkward "restarts"
4. Verify user doesn't have to repeat information

**Risk if Not Tested:**  
Poor UX, users feel like they're talking to disconnected bots.
