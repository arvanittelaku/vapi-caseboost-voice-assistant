## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW (5-10 minutes)

### Step 1: Configure Transfers in VAPI Dashboard

**This is the ONLY manual step remaining.**

1. Go to: https://dashboard.vapi.ai/assistants
2. Open **Sarah** (ID: 87bbafd3-e24d-4de6-ac76-9ec93d180571)
3. Find "Transfer Destinations" or "Squad" section
4. Add these 4 transfer destinations:

```
Paula:    8c09f5c7-c1f8-4015-b632-19b51456b522  (Performance Leads)
Alex:     c27cd255-230c-4a00-bd0d-8fb0dd97976a  (AI Intake)
Peter:    11a75fe5-0bbf-4c09-99bc-548830cd6af8  (PPC)
Patricia: e3152d1f-4e00-44f3-a5de-5125bbde4cc6  (Practice Areas)
```

5. Save the configuration

**📖 Detailed instructions:** See `docs/CONFIGURE-TRANSFERS-IN-DASHBOARD.md`

---

### Step 2: Test the Squad

Once transfers are configured in the dashboard:

```bash
# Make a test call
npm run test-vapi-call +12132127052

# Try these phrases:
# "We need immediate qualified leads" → Should transfer to Paula
# "We're missing calls after hours" → Should transfer to Alex
# "We want to run Google Ads" → Should transfer to Peter
# "We're a medical malpractice firm" → Should transfer to Patricia
```

---

## 📋 HOW SARAH'S ROUTING WORKS

Sarah's system message now includes these instructions:

```
When you detect specific service interests, immediately transfer:

1. PERFORMANCE LEAD DELIVERY → Paula
   Keywords: immediate leads, buy leads, qualified leads, performance leads, 
            lead delivery, ready to close, instant leads

2. AI INTAKE AUTOMATION → Alex
   Keywords: AI intake, automation, 24/7, after hours, chatbot, 
            automated responses, client capture, missing calls

3. PPC ADVERTISING → Peter
   Keywords: Google Ads, PPC, Facebook ads, Meta ads, paid advertising, 
            online ads, YouTube ads

4. PRACTICE AREA CONSULTATION → Patricia
   Keywords: medical malpractice, immigration law, personal injury, 
            family law, practice area, case values
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### API Configuration Applied

For all assistants:
- **Model:** GPT-4o (latest)
- **Temperature:** 0.7 (balanced creativity/consistency)
- **Voice Provider:** 11labs
- **Voice ID:** "sarah" (professional female voice)
- **System Messages:** Comprehensive role-specific prompts
- **First Messages:** Contextual greetings that reference Sarah's transfer

### Configuration is Persistent

All changes are saved in VAPI:
- Re-running `npm run configure-squad` will update them
- Changes persist across deployments
- No need to reconfigure on each call

---

## 🚨 WHY MANUAL DASHBOARD CONFIGURATION IS NEEDED

**VAPI's API Limitation:**

The VAPI API doesn't currently support configuring transfer destinations programmatically. We tried multiple approaches:

1. ❌ `tools` property - Not accepted by API
2. ❌ `model.functions` with transfer - Wrong format
3. ❌ `transferPlan` property - Doesn't exist in API
4. ❌ `transferDestinations` - Dashboard-only feature

**The Solution:**

VAPI requires transfer destinations to be configured through their dashboard UI. This is a one-time setup that takes 5-10 minutes.

---

## 📊 COMPARISON: What We Built vs What VAPI Needs

### Our Original Implementation (Custom Routing)
```
Sarah → Detects keywords
     → Calls custom function
     → Webhook returns specialist config
     → ❌ VAPI doesn't change assistant
```

### Current Implementation (VAPI Squads)
```
Sarah → Detects keywords
     → System message tells her to transfer
     → Uses VAPI's native transfer feature
     → ✅ Transfers to configured specialist
```

**Why This Works:**

- Uses VAPI's native Squad/transfer feature
- Sarah's system message explicitly instructs her to transfer
- Transfer destinations configured in dashboard
- Context automatically preserved by VAPI

---
