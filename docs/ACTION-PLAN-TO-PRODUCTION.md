## üéØ TASK 1: Configure Transfer Destinations

**Time Required:** 15 minutes  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Blocks all transfers)  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT DONE

### What Needs to Be Done

Currently, Sarah has transfer instructions in her system message, but the actual transfer destinations are **not configured** in the VAPI dashboard. This means transfers won't work until this is done.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1.1: Access VAPI Dashboard

```bash
# Open in browser
https://dashboard.vapi.ai/assistants
```

#### Step 1.2: Open Sarah's Assistant

- Look for: "CaseBoost Legal Assistant" or "Sarah"
- ID: `87bbafd3-e24d-4de6-ac76-9ec93d180571`
- Click to open

#### Step 1.3: Find Transfer Settings

Look for one of these sections:
- "Transfer Destinations"
- "Squad Settings"
- "Assistant Destinations"  
- "Tools" ‚Üí "transferCall"

(The exact name varies by VAPI dashboard version)

#### Step 1.4: Add Each Specialist

For each specialist, add as transfer destination:

**Paula (Performance Leads)**
```
Name: Paula - Performance Leads
Assistant ID: 8c09f5c7-c1f8-4015-b632-19b51456b522
Description: Specialist in immediate lead delivery and performance-based client acquisition
Transfer Message: "Let me connect you with Paula, our Performance Lead Delivery specialist."
Transfer Mode: rolling-history (if option exists)
```

**Alex (AI Intake)**
```
Name: Alex - AI Intake
Assistant ID: c27cd255-230c-4a00-bd0d-8fb0dd97976a
Description: Specialist in AI-powered client intake automation and 24/7 lead capture
Transfer Message: "I'll connect you with Alex, our AI Intake specialist."
Transfer Mode: rolling-history
```

**Peter (PPC)**
```
Name: Peter - PPC
Assistant ID: 11a75fe5-0bbf-4c09-99bc-548830cd6af8
Description: Specialist in PPC advertising for law firms, Google Ads, and Meta campaigns
Transfer Message: "Let me get Peter on the line, our PPC specialist."
Transfer Mode: rolling-history
```

**Patricia (Practice Areas)**
```
Name: Patricia - Practice Areas
Assistant ID: e3152d1f-4e00-44f3-a5de-5125bbde4cc6
Description: Specialist in practice area growth strategies and client acquisition
Transfer Message: "I'll connect you with Patricia, our Practice Area consultant."
Transfer Mode: rolling-history
```

#### Step 1.5: Save Configuration

- Click "Save" or "Update Assistant"
- Wait for confirmation message

### Verification

After saving, you should see all 4 specialists listed as transfer options for Sarah.

### If You Get Stuck

**Common Issue 1:** Can't find transfer settings
- **Solution:** Look for "Tools" section ‚Üí Add "transferCall" tool
- Or check "Squad" tab if it exists

**Common Issue 2:** Transfer mode not available
- **Solution:** That's okay! VAPI uses rolling-history by default for Squads

**Common Issue 3:** Need to create Squad first
- **Solution:** Go to "Squads" ‚Üí "Create Squad" ‚Üí Add Sarah + 4 specialists

## üéØ TASK 3: Update Voice Differentiation

**Time Required:** 10 minutes  
**Priority:** P1 (High - User experience)  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (2/4 need updates)

### What Needs to Be Done

Currently:
- ‚úÖ Sarah: ElevenLabs voice (distinct)
- ‚úÖ Paula: PlayHT Jennifer (female - distinct)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Alex: PlayHT Jennifer (same as Paula - needs change)
- ‚úÖ Peter: PlayHT Michael (male - distinct)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Patricia: PlayHT Michael (same as Peter - needs change)

**Problem:** Alex sounds like Paula, Patricia sounds like Peter. Users won't know when transfer occurred.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 3.1: Update Alex's Voice

1. Go to VAPI dashboard: https://dashboard.vapi.ai/assistants
2. Open Alex assistant (ID: `c27cd255-230c-4a00-bd0d-8fb0dd97976a`)
3. Find "Voice" settings
4. Change to a distinct male voice:
   - **Option 1:** PlayHT - "Larry" (male, professional)
   - **Option 2:** ElevenLabs - "Adam" (male, American)
   - **Option 3:** Any other male voice different from Peter
5. Save changes

#### Step 3.2: Update Patricia's Voice

1. Open Patricia assistant (ID: `e3152d1f-4e00-44f3-a5de-5125bbde4cc6`)
2. Find "Voice" settings
3. Change to a distinct female voice (different from Paula/Sarah):
   - **Option 1:** PlayHT - "Sophia" (female, professional)
   - **Option 2:** ElevenLabs - "Bella" (female, British)
   - **Option 3:** Any other female voice different from Paula
4. Save changes

### Verification

Make test calls and verify:
- Sarah sounds different from Paula
- Paula sounds different from Alex
- Alex sounds different from Peter
- Peter sounds different from Patricia
- Patricia sounds different from Sarah

**All 5 should be distinguishable!**

## üéØ TASK 4: Add Context Manager API Key

**Time Required:** 2 minutes  
**Priority:** P2 (Medium - Optional feature)  
**Complexity:** Very Low  
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT DONE

### What Needs to Be Done

The context manager (AI summarization feature) requires an LLM API key to work. This is **optional** - VAPI's native context preservation works without it, but this adds enhanced AI-powered summaries.

### Option A: Use OpenAI (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 2. Add to .env file
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here' >> .env

# 3. Restart server
npm start

# 4. Test context manager
npm run test-context-manager
```

**Cost:** ~$0.15 per 1M tokens (very cheap)  
**Speed:** ~1-2 seconds per summary  
**Quality:** Excellent

### Option B: Use Groq (Free Tier Available)

```bash
# 1. Get API key from https://console.groq.com
# 2. Add to .env file
echo 'GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key-here' >> .env
echo 'LLM_PROVIDER=groq' >> .env

# 3. Restart server
npm start

# 4. Test context manager
npm run test-context-manager
```

**Cost:** Free tier available  
**Speed:** ~0.5 seconds per summary (faster!)  
**Quality:** Excellent

### Option C: Skip It (Use VAPI's Native Context Only)

If you don't want the enhanced AI summarization:
- Do nothing
- VAPI's built-in `rolling-history` will still preserve context
- You just won't get the additional AI-powered summaries

**This is perfectly fine for launch!**

---

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Transfer doesn't occur

**Symptoms:** Sarah tries to transfer but call continues with Sarah

**Possible Causes:**
1. Transfer destinations not configured in dashboard
2. Assistant IDs are wrong
3. Squad not created

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check Task 1 was completed correctly
2. Verify assistant IDs match:
   - Paula: `8c09f5c7-c1f8-4015-b632-19b51456b522`
   - Alex: `c27cd255-230c-4a00-bd0d-8fb0dd97976a`
   - Peter: `11a75fe5-0bbf-4c09-99bc-548830cd6af8`
   - Patricia: `e3152d1f-4e00-44f3-a5de-5125bbde4cc6`
3. Check if you need to create a Squad first in VAPI dashboard

---

### Issue: Context not preserved

**Symptoms:** Specialist doesn't know what you told Sarah

**Possible Causes:**
1. Transfer mode not set to rolling-history
2. VAPI transcription delay
3. Context manager not running

**Solutions:**
1. In transfer destination settings, ensure "Transfer Mode" is set to "rolling-history"
2. Wait 2-3 seconds after talking to Sarah before expecting transfer
3. Check if context manager is optional - VAPI's native context should still work

---

### Issue: Voices sound the same

**Symptoms:** Can't tell when transfer occurred

**Possible Causes:**
1. Voice settings not updated in dashboard
2. Using same voice provider/voice for multiple assistants

**Solutions:**
1. Complete Task 3 (update Alex and Patricia voices)
2. Choose distinctly different voices (different gender, accent, tone)
3. Test with headphones to hear subtle differences

---

### Issue: Context manager not working

**Symptoms:** `npm run test-context-manager` fails with API error

**Possible Causes:**
1. No API key in `.env`
2. Invalid API key
3. API quota exceeded

**Solutions:**
1. Add API key to `.env` file (see Task 4)
2. Verify key is valid at provider's dashboard
3. Check API usage/billing
4. **Or:** Skip this feature - VAPI's native context works without it

---

## üìû SUPPORT

If you get stuck:

1. **Check VAPI Documentation:** https://docs.vapi.ai/squads
2. **Check audit report:** `docs/PROJECT-AUDIT-COMPLETE.md`
3. **Review configuration:** `scripts/configure-squad.js`
4. **Check logs:** Server logs show transfer attempts
